    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Scripted Pipeline

Scripted pipelines use a more flexible, but complex syntax.

```groovy
node {
    stage('Build') {
        echo 'Building...'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Testing...'
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        echo 'Deploying...'
    }
}
```
